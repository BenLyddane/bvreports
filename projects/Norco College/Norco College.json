Additionally, standardizing on a single manufacturer for all terminal units will simplify maintenance and spare parts inventory.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Potential 5-10% cost savings on terminal unit procurement (approximately 34 units), improved delivery coordination, and reduced procurement administrative overhead.",
      "implementation": "1. Request package pricing from Titus and authorized distributors\n2. Compare with package pricing from alternate manufacturers (Krueger, Price)\n3. Evaluate total cost of ownership including maintenance considerations\n4. Negotiate improved warranty terms based on volume purchase",

    "summary": "The HVAC system procurement for Norco College's Center for Human Performance & Kinesiology encompasses a comprehensive equipment package including air handling units, exhaust fans, split system air conditioners, fan coil units, and air terminal units. The project requires coordinating multiple system types from manufacturers including Energy Labs, Greenheck, Carrier, and Titus. Several alternatives from manufacturers like Krueger, Price Industries, Daikin, Mitsubishi, and LG have been identified that could provide cost or performance benefits while maintaining system compatibility.",

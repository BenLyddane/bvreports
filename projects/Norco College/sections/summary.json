    "summary": "The HVAC system design for the Norco College Center for Human Performance & Kinesiology utilizes a combination of central air handling units with VAV distribution and distributed split systems. The equipment specification includes quality manufacturers with appropriate commercial-grade equipment. Several opportunities exist to enhance the design through system integration, energy efficiency improvements, and careful attention to acoustics and controls.",
    "keyFindings": [
      "The project employs a mixed-system approach with central AHUs and multiple split systems, requiring careful coordination.",
      "Extensive use of VAV terminal units provides good zone-level control capabilities but requires proper commissioning.",
      "Standard equipment selections are suitable for the application, but opportunities exist for enhanced efficiency.",
      "Control integration will be critical for optimal system performance.",
      "Alternative manufacturers could provide comparable performance with potential advantages in specific areas."

    "summary": "The HVAC system procurement for Norco College's Center for Human Performance & Kinesiology encompasses a comprehensive equipment package including air handling units, exhaust fans, split system air conditioners, fan coil units, and air terminal units. The project requires coordinating multiple system types from manufacturers including Energy Labs, Greenheck, Carrier, and Titus. Several alternatives from manufacturers like Krueger, Price Industries, Daikin, Mitsubishi, and LG have been identified that could provide cost or performance benefits while maintaining system compatibility.",
    "keyFindings": [
      "The mixed-system approach using central AHUs and split systems requires careful coordination of equipment procurement and installation timing",
      "Alternative manufacturers for air terminal units and split systems could offer comparable performance with potential cost advantages",
      "Integration of control systems across diverse equipment types is critical for optimal system performance",
      "Energy efficiency improvements through VRF systems or energy recovery components represent significant opportunities",
      "The extensive number of VAV/CAV terminal units (35+) suggests bulk purchasing opportunities"
    ],
    "highestPriorityActions": [
      "Evaluate cost-benefit of alternative manufacturers, particularly for the numerous terminal units and split systems",
      "Ensure procurement timeline accommodates long lead items, particularly the custom Energy Labs AHUs",
      "Coordinate control system compatibility across all equipment components during procurement phase",
      "Consider upgrading specifications to include energy recovery for AHUs and VRF technology for split systems"

      "recommendation": "Implement enhanced energy monitoring and dashboard system integrated with BAS",
      "rationale": "The complex systems in this laboratory facility would benefit from detailed energy monitoring. Current design includes basic monitoring, but an enhanced system would provide better visibility into energy use patterns and identify optimization opportunities.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Potential 5-10% energy savings through identification of inefficiencies and operational improvements. Better data for future facility planning and optimization.",
      "implementation": "Specify additional power metering points, especially on laboratory equipment circuits. Implement dashboard system accessible to facility management team. Include trending and analysis capabilities.",

      "recommendation": "Evaluate potential for additional variable frequency drives on secondary pumping systems",
      "rationale": "While VFDs are included on primary equipment, some secondary distribution systems use constant speed pumping. Adding VFDs to these systems would allow for better pressure control and energy savings during partial load operation.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Estimated 15-20% pump energy savings for affected systems. Improved system control and potential for extended equipment life due to reduced cycling and wear.",
      "implementation": "Review secondary pumping systems, particularly for non-critical applications. Evaluate control strategies and implement VFDs where beneficial.",

      "recommendation": "Implement lab exhaust fan optimization system",
      "rationale": "The current design includes constant volume exhaust for laboratory spaces, which is energy-intensive. A wind-responsive, variable volume exhaust system could maintain safe plume dispersion while reducing energy consumption.",

      "recommendation": "Consider alternative suppliers for specified Strobic exhaust fans",
      "rationale": "Strobic Tri-Stack fans are specified as basis of design but have long lead times and are typically high cost. Alternatives from Greenheck or Twin City Fan could provide similar performance at lower cost.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Potential 5-8% cost savings on exhaust fan package. Improved schedule flexibility with potentially shorter lead times.",
      "implementation": "Review alternative manufacturers and confirm performance requirements. Verify plume dispersion modeling with alternative equipment. Confirm structural and dimensional compatibility.",

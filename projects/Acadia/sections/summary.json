    "summary": "The proposed HVAC system for this Riverside, CA project incorporates a diverse range of equipment to meet various heating, cooling, and ventilation needs. The design utilizes a hybrid approach with both split systems and packaged rooftop units for cooling, dedicated outdoor air for ventilation, and a dual condensing boiler system for heating. While the equipment selections are appropriate for the application, there are opportunities for optimization in controls integration, energy recovery, and system operation.",
    "keyFindings": [
      "The hybrid cooling approach provides good zoning capabilities but requires careful control integration",
      "Dedicated outdoor air system provides centralized fresh air delivery with potential for energy recovery",
      "High-efficiency condensing boilers provide good redundancy and efficiency for the heating system",
      "Multiple exhaust systems indicate specialized ventilation requirements that must be carefully balanced"
    ],
    "highestPriorityActions": [
      "Implement integrated building automation system for coordinated control",
      "Ensure proper refrigerant line routing and sizing for split systems",
      "Verify kitchen exhaust compliance with applicable codes",
      "Develop comprehensive water treatment strategy for hydronic system"

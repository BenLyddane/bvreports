    "summary": "The Riverside HVAC System Upgrade project features a comprehensive equipment procurement strategy that combines Samsung HVAC split systems, York packaged rooftop units, iAire dedicated outdoor air systems, Greenheck ventilation fans, and Raypak condensing boilers. The procurement plan balances performance requirements with cost considerations, offering several alternative manufacturers that could provide cost savings or enhanced features. The project requires careful coordination of equipment from multiple vendors while ensuring system compatibility and integration.",
    "keyFindings": [
      "Multiple equipment types from different manufacturers require a coordinated procurement and control strategy for optimal system performance",
      "Alternative manufacturers could provide cost savings up to 5% (Daikin) or premium options with enhanced efficiency at 6-10% higher cost (Trane, Aerco)",
      "Hybrid cooling approach with both split systems and packaged units offers zoning flexibility but creates procurement complexity",
      "Integrated building automation system is critical to coordinate diverse equipment and could deliver 15-20% energy savings"
    ],
    "highestPriorityActions": [
      "Implement an integrated building automation system with BACnet compatibility for all equipment to ensure coordinated control",
      "Consider alternative manufacturers like Daikin for split systems which could provide 5% cost savings with minimal compatibility issues",
      "Develop a comprehensive procurement schedule that accounts for lead times of all equipment types",
      "Establish water treatment specifications for the hydronic system to ensure condensing boiler efficiency and longevity"

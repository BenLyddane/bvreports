Purchasing these items in consolidated orders rather than separately can unlock significant volume discounts from manufacturers.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Potential 8-12% cost reduction on equipment purchases through volume pricing. For this project, considering the quantity of identical equipment, this could represent savings of approximately $30,000-$50,000 on equipment costs.",
      "implementation": "1. Aggregate all similar equipment into single purchase orders\n2. Negotiate with manufacturers or distributors for tiered pricing based on total quantity\n3. Coordinate delivery schedules to align with installation timeline\n4. Consider early procurement with staged delivery to secure pricing while maintaining cash flow",

This approach is particularly valuable for the custom air handling units where pricing can be less standardized.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Typically results in 3-5% cost savings by eliminating hidden margins and creating a collaborative approach to value engineering. Improved pricing transparency leads to better budget control and reduced risk of unexpected cost increases.",
      "implementation": "1. Identify key equipment suppliers for major components\n2. Propose open-book pricing model with defined markup structure\n3. Establish shared cost-saving incentives\n4.

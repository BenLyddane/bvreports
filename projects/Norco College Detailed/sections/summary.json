    "summary": "The HVAC system design for the Norco College Center for Human Performance & Kinesiology utilizes a combination of central air handling units with VAV distribution and distributed split systems. The equipment specification includes quality manufacturers with appropriate commercial-grade equipment for an educational/athletic facility. The design demonstrates attention to zoning and control requirements specific to this building type. Several opportunities exist to enhance the design through system integration, energy efficiency improvements, and careful attention to acoustics and controls. By implementing the recommended improvements, the project could achieve significant energy savings, improved occupant comfort, and reduced operational costs over the building lifecycle.",
    "keyFindings": [
      "The project employs a mixed-system approach with central AHUs and multiple split systems, requiring careful coordination for optimal performance.",
      "Extensive use of VAV terminal units provides good zone-level control capabilities but requires proper commissioning and acoustic treatment.",

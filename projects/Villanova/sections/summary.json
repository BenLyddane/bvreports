    "summary": "The Villanova University Founders Hall HVAC renovation project presents a complex mix of hydronic, airside, and DX systems that will require careful coordination during procurement, installation, and commissioning. The critical path items, including the cooling tower, DOAS, and VRF components, have significant lead times and should be prioritized for early procurement. Controls integration across multiple system types represents a high-risk area that demands focused attention early in the project lifecycle. Several opportunities exist for cost and schedule optimization, particularly in the areas of prefabrication, alternative manufacturer evaluation, and strategically sequenced submittals.",
    "keyFindings": [
      "High-risk equipment with extended lead times (cooling tower, DOAS, VRF) requires expedited procurement",
      "Multiple system types (hydronic, airside, VRF) with different manufacturers present controls integration challenges",
      "Specifications contain several gaps or discrepancies that should be addressed via RFIs",
      "Water-source heat pump quantity provides opportunity for prefabrication efficiency",
      "Alternative manufacturers for VRF components may offer cost and schedule advantages"
    ],
    "highestPriorityActions": [
      "Develop expedited submittal and procurement plan for long-lead equipment (cooling tower, DOAS, VRF)",
      "Schedule comprehensive controls coordination meeting with all stakeholders",
      "Submit consolidated RFI addressing specification gaps and discrepancies",
      "Evaluate alternative VRF manufacturers for potential cost and schedule benefits",
      "Develop WSHP prefabrication strategy to improve installation efficiency"

The critical path items, including the cooling tower, DOAS, and VRF components, have significant lead times and should be prioritized for early procurement. Controls integration across multiple system types represents a high-risk area that demands focused attention early in the project lifecycle. Several opportunities exist for cost and schedule optimization, particularly in the areas of prefabrication, alternative manufacturer evaluation, and strategically sequenced submittals.",

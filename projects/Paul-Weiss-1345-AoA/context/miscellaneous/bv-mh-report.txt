VAV Units: BOD Titus

    These are all single duct terminals without reheat. Low budget.
    VAVs on plan have no type selected.

HVAC Fans: BOD Greenheck

    DXF-14-1 serves dishwasher. Aluminum wheel needed for dishwasher exhaust fans (DXF-14-1, DXF-14-2. Also, BOD fan may not be compatible with EC motor.
    Engineer requests add-alt breakout price for transfer fans serving IDF rooms.
    Suggest confirming controls is being handled by separate controls contractor. If not, appurtenances (e.g., thermostats for IDF rooms, time clocks, BMS integration) may be needed from the manufacturer.

FCUs: BOD IEC

    Fairly straightforward. Some manufacturers have piping packages included from factory - make sure to level if they’re included by default.
    No external static pressure requirements are listed in the schedules; fan performance may vary.

WSHPs: BOD Bosch (Florida Heat Pump)

    BOD uses A2L refrigerant.
    Some units are add-alternates (AC-35-2, AC-40-2).
    Extended range package is required - this is sometimes called ground-source or geothermal. Would be good to confirm actual requirements (may be listed in specifications).
    No heating performance requirements are listed.

CRACs: BOD AboveAir, Bosch WSHP

    CRACs have mixed refrigerants, which could cause maintenance frustrations.
    “Extended range unit” is unclear and atypical for CRAC units. What condenser water temperature ranges is the engineer expecting to see? The partial condenser water riser diagrams indicate a standard cooling tower; unsure why extended-range units are required.
    Alternate Manufacturers (Bosch): Refer to WSHPs above.

Hydronic Pumps: BOD Grundfos

    Riser diagram calls for CWP-37-1/2/3 as 150 GPM, but schedule calls for 175 GPM.
    CWP-37-1/2/3 are “lead/lag”. Is the third pump for redundancy, or do all 3 need to stage and run at the same time? Based on 5” CW connection, assuming pump 3 is for redundancy.

Self-Contained Units: BOD Mammoth

    AC-15-1 and AC-16-1 serve VAVs, so will need VAV control. 2” ESP is probably fine for the short duct run, but there is a lot of ductwork jogging to get there. Fan size might go up in 100% CDs.
    MUA-14-1 is a SCU but handles 100% outside air and has a 227kW electric reheat coil. This building is going to be ConEd’s preferred customer.
    Basis of Design (Mammoth) is a premium product and has few true competitors. Daikin is likely the closest, with Trane and UCA potentially able to meet the requirements.

Electrostatic Precipitators (Pollution Control Unit): BOD Halton

    Airmaid and PurifiedAir both make electrostatic precipitators, but the BOD is for a packaged exhaust unit with the ESP built in. This would be better categorized as a “pollution control unit”.

      "recommendation": "Early Procurement of Critical HVAC Equipment",
      "rationale": "Daikin RTUs have 10-20 week lead times which will significantly impact project schedule if not ordered early. Starting the procurement process immediately can prevent schedule delays.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Prevention of 4-8 week project delays, potential cost savings of 2-3% by avoiding rush shipping fees and emergency substitutions.",
      "implementation": "1. Release HVAC package early for shop drawing submissions\n2. Fast-track submittal reviews for Daikin RTUs\n3. Issue early release purchase orders with manufacturing priority\n4. Establish weekly tracking of manufacturing status",

      "recommendation": "Bundle Equipment Purchases by Manufacturer",
      "rationale": "Consolidating purchases from the same manufacturer or supplier can leverage volume discounts and streamline the procurement process. For example, purchasing all exhaust fans from Greenheck or all electric heaters from the same supplier.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Potential 3-5% cost reduction through volume discounts, simplified procurement process, and reduced shipping costs.",
      "implementation": "1. Group equipment items by potential supplier\n2. Request package pricing from representatives\n3. Evaluate total cost of ownership including shipping and coordination\n4. Standardize on manufacturers where advantageous",

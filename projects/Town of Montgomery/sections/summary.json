    "summary": "The HVAC and plumbing systems designed for the Town of Montgomery Police Station incorporate energy-efficient equipment and provide for reliable operation. The use of variable air volume distribution with heat pump technology balances energy efficiency with occupant comfort. The water treatment system meets regulatory requirements while providing redundancy for critical functions. Several issues require attention, including long lead times for critical equipment, model number discrepancies for the ductless split system, and wind restraint requirements for rooftop equipment.",
    "keyFindings": [
      "The selected equipment meets or exceeds energy efficiency requirements",
      "The HVAC system provides appropriate zoning for different building areas",
      "Water treatment systems include redundancy for critical functions",
      "The overall design follows current best practices for safety and reliability",
      "Long lead times for Daikin RTUs (10-20 weeks) present schedule risk",
      "Model number discrepancies in the ductless split system specifications need resolution",
      "Wind restraint requirements for rooftop equipment require PE certification"

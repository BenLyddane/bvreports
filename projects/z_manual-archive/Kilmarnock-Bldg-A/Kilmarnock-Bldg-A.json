    "summary": "This all-electric residential building project for Boston Children's Hospital requires careful procurement planning for key MEP systems to meet both performance and sustainability goals. The VRF system, energy recovery ventilators, and domestic hot water system represent the most significant equipment purchases, with several viable manufacturer options available for each. Given the project's Passive House and LEED Gold certifiable requirements, equipment selection must balance efficiency, cost, and reliability while ensuring compatibility with building management systems. Early procurement and tracking of long-lead items will be critical to maintaining the construction schedule.",
    "keyFindings": [
      "The VRF system has multiple viable alternatives from Daikin, Samsung, and LG that could provide cost savings of 2-5% while maintaining required performance specifications",
      "The domestic hot water system offers two distinct approaches: a Mitsubishi CO2-based heat pump system or an alternative Watts Aegis configuration, both compatible with Passive House requirements",
      "Energy recovery ventilators (ERVs) are required for every dwelling unit and common space, making bulk procurement a significant opportunity for cost savings",
      "The project requires specialized equipment with potentially long lead times, including the generator, VRF systems, and domestic hot water components",

Similarly, all fresh air intake located on the roof will be located minimum 25’-0” away from the any general exhaust and relief air to avoid any opportunity for the ingestion of containment and to exceed the minimum requirements from the ASHRAE standard 170 and 62.1.  4. Sustainability: Beyond airside economizer, the mechanical systems will be based on an integrated design approach where the design team (architects and engineers) collectively analyze and model the massing of the building to create a building that uses less energy.  The mechanical systems will be “right sized” and made-up of premium efficiency components.  Variable air-volume air system design will be implemented in all non-critical and non-clinical spaces to save energy. Variable frequency drives on fans and pumps will be provided to save energy at reduced demand times.    5. Reliability: Multiple-like sized pumps, heat exchangers, etc. serving like space will be headered together within respective mechanical rooms.  The coupling will provide 100% redundancy if any one system fails.  Through the use of controls and variable frequency drives, the space conditions will be hardly affected. The air handling unit will be designed to allow for a minimum one (1) fan failure while still maintaining 100% airflow. Unit and distribution systems will be designed with a minimum of 10% spare capacity.  D3010 - ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA A. Environmental Criteria 1.

Each sensor output is then sent to a signal transducer that will read all the sensors and pass through one signal that represents the sensor with the highest reading to the air handler k. As a result, ventilation rates will be controlled to ensure the most critical space is always adequately ventilated 2. Advanced Control Applications a. Optimal Start: starts HVAC equipment only as early as required to bring the building setpoints to comfort levels for occupancy b. Optimal Stop: Determines the earliest possible time to initiate setback temperatures before unoccupied periods while still maintaining occupant comfort c. Demand Limiting or Load Shedding: Monitors electric meters and current draw on high-demand equipment, then relaxes setpoints to immediately reduce demand. This technique can, for example, prevent a chiller from further loading, but can also globally change HVAC setpoints throughout the building to shed electric load to avoid peak utility charges 3. Air handling systems should operate with 100% outdoor air at the completion of construction activities.  Operation at 100% outside air would continue until enough time has passed to lower emitted contamination concentrations to near background levels.

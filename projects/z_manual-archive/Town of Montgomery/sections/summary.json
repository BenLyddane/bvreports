    "summary": "The Town of Montgomery Police Station HVAC project involves procurement of various equipment including packaged rooftop units, split system AC units, exhaust fans, unit heaters, and water treatment systems. Critical procurement concerns include long lead times (10-20 weeks) for Daikin rooftop units, model compatibility issues with the Trane split system specification, and wind restraint requirements for rooftop installations. The project requires early procurement planning to mitigate schedule risks while ensuring proper equipment selection that meets the project's performance specifications.",
    "keyFindings": [
      "Long lead times (10-20 weeks) for critical Daikin RTUs present significant schedule risks",
      "Model number discrepancies exist in the split system specifications (Trane models with Mitsubishi designations)",
      "Multiple supplier options are available for most equipment types with cost variations of -5% to +7%",
      "Wind restraint certification requirements add complexity to rooftop equipment installation",
      "Water treatment systems require specific NSF certifications per NYS Department of Health regulations"
    ],
    "highestPriorityActions": [
      "Immediately initiate procurement of long-lead Daikin rooftop units to prevent project delays",
      "Verify correct manufacturer and model specifications for the ductless split system before ordering",
      "Develop a comprehensive procurement schedule that prioritizes equipment based on lead times",
      "Ensure all rooftop equipment meets wind restraint requirements with proper PE-stamped documentation"

The Engineered systems will be designed to meet ASHRAE 90.1 – 2019, Additional energy conservation and sustainability features considered are as follows: 1. Enthalpy controlled economizer cycle for air conditioning systems, to take advantage of "cool" outside air to provide space cooling without or with reduced usage of refrigeration system. 2. Use of variable air volume type air conditioning systems for areas which do not require constant humidity or maintained-pressure relationships with adjacent areas.  Variable speed motor drives for VAV system if it is economical and feasible, supply and returns fans.  VAV systems will incorporate air measuring stations to accurately control supply and return fan performance. 3. Larger temperature differential (supply - return temperature) for chilled & hot water systems.  Primarily, this will involve application of chilled water equipment with temperature differentials of 14-16 degrees F and hot water with temperature differential of 30 degrees F. 4. Use of variable speed pumping for all hydronic systems; hot water reheat, pre-heat and radiant heating. 5.

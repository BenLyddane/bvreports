      "recommendation": "Standardize Air Handling Unit Manufacturers",
      "rationale": "The mechanical schedules show multiple air handling units (AHU-1, AHU-2, AHU-3) and energy recovery units (ERU-1, ERU-2) without specified manufacturers. Standardizing on a single manufacturer for these units would increase purchasing leverage, simplify maintenance, and reduce spare parts inventory requirements.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Potential 5-10% cost savings on equipment purchase through volume discounting, plus ongoing operational savings through simplified maintenance and reduced spare parts inventory.",
      "implementation": "1. Select preferred manufacturer based on performance specifications and lifecycle cost analysis. 2. Negotiate project-wide pricing agreement with selected manufacturer. 3. Update mechanical specifications to reflect standardized manufacturer selection.",

      "id": 2,
      "recommendation": "Consolidate Chiller Procurement with Trane",
      "rationale": "Specifications indicate Trane as the specified manufacturer for CH-1 and CH-2 chillers. A coordinated approach to procure both chillers simultaneously from Trane can yield better pricing and ensure compatibility with building systems and controls.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Estimated 8-12% savings on combined equipment purchase versus individual procurement. Additional savings through coordinated installation, startup, and commissioning.",
      "implementation": "1. Package CH-1 and CH-2 as a single procurement item. 2. Negotiate with Trane for project-specific discounts based on combined purchase. 3. Coordinate delivery schedules to optimize installation sequencing.",

      "recommendation": "Standardize Fan Coil and Blower Coil Units",
      "rationale": "The project includes numerous fan coil units (FCUs) and blower coil units (BCAHs) with multiple types and configurations. The dashboard shows no specified BOD (Basis of Design) manufacturer for these units, indicating an opportunity to select a single preferred manufacturer.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Potential 7-15% cost reduction through bulk purchasing, simplified installation, and standardized controls and connections. Long-term maintenance and replacement costs would also be reduced.",
      "implementation": "1. Review FCU and BCAH specifications to identify a manufacturer capable of meeting all required configurations. 2. Negotiate volume discount pricing. 3. Standardize connection types and control interfaces for simplified installation.",
      "priority": "Medium"

      "id": 4,
      "recommendation": "Implement Early Equipment Procurement Strategy for Long Lead Items",
      "rationale": "Major mechanical equipment such as air handling units, chillers, and boilers typically have extended lead times (12-20 weeks or more). Early procurement of these items can prevent project delays and potentially secure better pricing before manufacturer price increases.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Schedule impact: Potential reduction in overall project timeline by 4-8 weeks. Cost impact: Protection against price escalation, estimated at 3-5% annual inflation for HVAC equipment.",
      "implementation": "1. Identify critical long-lead items (chillers, AHUs, boilers). 2. Create early procurement packages for these items. 3. Secure storage arrangements if necessary. 4. Coordinate delivery schedules with installation timeline.",

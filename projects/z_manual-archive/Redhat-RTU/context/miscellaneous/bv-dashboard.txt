Rafal,

Following up from our Monday meeting. Ben and I reviewed the BOD again. The big point that sticks out to us is the electric heating discrepancy between Ascent (CaptiveAire) and the BOD (Valent).

The BOD has an 80 degree LAT in winter with the wheel off and the electric heating fully on. This is typically sufficient for a DOAS/ventilation application. Unsure why they would need more than that.

I know this was a quick turnaround job, let me know if it's helpful or you want additional context.

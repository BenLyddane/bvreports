      "recommendation": "Implement Strategic Switchgear Procurement Plan",
      "rationale": "The electrical one-line diagrams show extensive switchgear requirements. A strategic procurement plan for switchgear would account for long lead times, coordinate factory witness testing, and potentially reduce costs through standardization of manufacturers and specifications.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Potential cost savings of 5-8% through standardization and volume purchasing. Reduced risk of schedule delays by proactively managing long lead time items. Improved quality control through coordinated factory witness testing.",
      "implementation": "1. Create comprehensive inventory of all required switchgear from electrical diagrams. 2. Develop standardized specifications where possible. 3. Engage with manufacturers early to secure production slots. 4. Consider advance procurement of long-lead components. 5. Coordinate factory witness testing to verify critical performance parameters before shipment.",

      "recommendation": "Consolidate PDU Purchases with Vendor-Managed Inventory",
      "rationale": "The project requires multiple Power Distribution Units (PDUs) as shown in the electrical drawings. Implementing a vendor-managed inventory approach for PDUs could reduce on-site storage requirements, ensure just-in-time delivery, and potentially secure better pricing through a committed volume agreement.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Reduced on-site storage costs and potential damage. Improved cash flow by delaying payment until equipment is needed on site. Potential 3-5% cost reduction through committed volume agreement with manufacturer.",
      "implementation": "1. Identify total PDU requirements and delivery schedule based on construction timeline. 2. Negotiate with manufacturers for a vendor-managed inventory program. 3. Establish clear delivery protocols and acceptance criteria. 4. Implement tracking system for vendor-managed inventory to maintain project schedule compliance.",

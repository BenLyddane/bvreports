    "summary": "The Norco College Center for Human Performance & Kinesiology project involves comprehensive HVAC system installation including air handling units, exhaust fans, split system air conditioners, fan coil units, and air terminal units. The procurement strategy encompasses multiple equipment types from specific manufacturers like Energy Labs, Greenheck, Carrier, and Titus. With a project start date of 7/22/2025 and a proposal due date of 5/28/2025, strategic procurement planning is essential to ensure timely equipment delivery and installation for this 40,741 sq. ft. facility.",
    "keyFindings": [
      "The project requires a mix of custom and standard HVAC equipment with specific manufacturers identified for each component, necessitating multi-vendor coordination",
      "Long-lead items include custom indoor central-station air-handling units from Energy Labs that may require early procurement to meet the project timeline",
      "Alternative manufacturer options exist for air terminal units and split systems that could offer cost savings or performance improvements",
      "The extensive quantity of terminal units (35+ VAV/CAV boxes) represents a significant portion of the equipment package with standardization opportunities",
      "California location may impose additional regulatory and compliance requirements affecting equipment specifications and procurement"
    ],
    "highestPriorityActions": [
      "Secure pricing and lead times for the custom Energy Labs air handling units immediately, as these will likely have the longest procurement cycle",
      "Evaluate alternate manufacturers (Krueger, Price Industries for terminal units; Daikin, Mitsubishi, LG for split systems) for potential cost savings while maintaining performance requirements",
      "Develop a phased delivery schedule aligned with construction sequence to avoid storage issues while ensuring equipment is available when needed",
      "Implement quality control measures specific to the large quantity of terminal units to ensure consistent performance across all installations"

      "recommendation": "Package Purchase of Terminal Units for Volume Discount",
      "rationale": "The project requires 34 Titus DESV air terminal units. Purchasing these units as a complete package rather than individually can result in significant quantity discounts. Additionally, standardizing on a single manufacturer for all terminal units will simplify maintenance and spare parts inventory.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Potential 5-10% cost savings on terminal unit procurement (approximately 34 units), improved delivery coordination, and reduced procurement administrative overhead.",
      "implementation": "1. Request package pricing from Titus and authorized distributors\n2. Compare with package pricing from alternate manufacturers (Krueger, Price)\n3. Evaluate total cost of ownership including maintenance considerations\n4. Negotiate improved warranty terms based on volume purchase",
      "priority": "High"

      "recommendation": "Consolidate Split System Purchases with Competitive Bidding",
      "rationale": "The project includes 8 identical Carrier condensing units (38MAR925DAA3) and 7 matching fan coil units (40KAH036026A3). Alternative manufacturers (Daikin, Mitsubishi, LG) have been identified. A competitive bid process across all manufacturers with bulk purchasing can yield better pricing and potential performance improvements.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Potential 8-15% cost reduction on split system equipment, improved warranty terms, and possibility of enhanced performance specifications or features at the same price point.",
      "implementation": "1. Develop performance-based specification that allows multiple manufacturers\n2. Request bids from all identified alternative manufacturers\n3. Evaluate lifecycle costs including energy efficiency and maintenance\n4. Consider standardizing with manufacturer of other campus equipment",

      "recommendation": "Pre-purchase Critical Air Handling Units to Mitigate Schedule Risk",
      "rationale": "The four custom Energy Labs air handling units (AHUs) typically have long lead times that could impact the project schedule. Pre-purchasing these units ahead of other equipment can prevent schedule delays, particularly as the project is scheduled to start 7/22/2025.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Reduced risk of project delays, potential cost savings by avoiding expedite fees, and better coordination of installation activities. Custom AHUs typically have 16-20 week lead times.",
      "implementation": "1. Confirm final AHU specifications early in the project\n2. Issue purchase orders for AHUs before other equipment\n3. Secure storage if units arrive before installation readiness\n4. Coordinate delivery timing with construction schedule",
      "priority": "High"

      "recommendation": "Evaluate Local Stock Availability for Exhaust Fans",
      "rationale": "The four Greenheck exhaust fans (models CUE-140-VG and CUE-100B-VG) are standard products that may be available from local distributors with shorter lead times than factory orders. Local sourcing could reduce procurement time and shipping costs.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Potential 2-4 week reduction in lead time, reduced shipping costs, and increased flexibility for installation scheduling.",
      "implementation": "1. Contact local Greenheck representatives to check stock availability\n2. Compare pricing between stock units and factory orders\n3. Verify that stock units meet all project specifications\n4. Include local availability as a factor in purchase decisions",
      "priority": "Medium"

    {
      "id": 5,
      "recommendation": "Establish Equipment Procurement Master Schedule",
      "rationale": "With multiple equipment types from different manufacturers, a comprehensive procurement schedule is essential. This should align delivery timing with installation needs, account for varying lead times, and create accountability for timely ordering.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Optimized cash flow by preventing premature purchases, reduced storage requirements, minimized risk of equipment damage from extended storage, and better coordination with installation contractors.",
      "implementation": "1. Document lead times for all major equipment\n2. Work backward from construction schedule to determine order dates\n3. Track approval submittals to prevent delays\n4. Establish regular procurement status reporting",

      "summary": "The proposed HVAC system for this Riverside, CA project incorporates a diverse range of equipment to meet various heating, cooling, and ventilation needs. The design utilizes a hybrid approach with both split systems and packaged rooftop units for cooling, dedicated outdoor air for ventilation, and a dual condensing boiler system for heating. While the equipment selections are appropriate for the application, there are opportunities for optimization in controls integration, energy recovery, and system operation.",

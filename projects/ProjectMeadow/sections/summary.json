    "summary": "Project Meadow involves the installation of a comprehensive HVAC system with a focus on energy efficiency and building automation. The procurement strategy centers on high-quality equipment from specified manufacturers including York, Temtrol, Enviro-Tec, and Loren Cook. The project includes air handling units, fan coil units, ventilation fans, and associated control systems with BACnet compatibility for open protocol integration.",
    "keyFindings": [
      "The project requires BTL certified BACnet-based building management system (BMS) with Tridium Niagara Framework N4 that must remain open and unlocked for owner access and maintenance",
      "Careful coordination is required between multiple contractors including BMS, mechanical, and network communications contractors for successful integration of all systems",
      "The project is targeting LEED platinum certification which impacts equipment selection and system monitoring requirements",
      "Equipment procurement must account for precise specifications including MERV 13 filtration, stainless steel drain pans, and specific control requirements"
    ],
    "highestPriorityActions": [
      "Secure commitments from specified manufacturers (York, Enviro-Tec, Temtrol, Loren Cook) to meet delivery schedules for the project timeline targeting March 2025 completion",
      "Coordinate with network communications contractor on OT network infrastructure requirements for BMS integration",
      "Develop quality control plan to ensure all equipment meets specifications including energy efficiency ratings and BACnet compatibility",
      "Establish procurement tracking system to monitor equipment delivery status against construction schedule milestones"

the static pressure needed to overcome terminal-unit discharge system losses.

d. Where duct conditions are not suitable for Pitot-tube traverse
measurements, a coil traverse may be acceptable.

E. Network Communication Contractor (NCC) provides infrastructure cabling and
backbone. NCC provides cabling from the patch panel out to the BMS IP device and
cabling between the patch panel and OT network switch.
F. Refer to “Scope of Work” paragraph for additional information.
G. The BMS system installed for this project for building system control, monitoring and
data collection should leverage open protocols for complete device level
interoperability. All devices must allow for multiple connections while maintaining 99%

protocol should exist at the device level and not at the level of a head-end computer,
server or network controller functioning as a gateway. The entire BMS shall be open to
allow other systems to access the data being collected. The BMS shall include the
ability to implement an industry standard protocol at the device level (BACnet , or
Modbus (subject to approval by the OTR), etc.), provide unrestrictive software licenses,
databases, and administrative access privileges, provide all the software tools required
for network management, device and controller configuration and programming, as well
as all software tools required to update the user interface functionality. All data points
shall be defined as BACnet objects (native as well as 3rd party software integration
points). The Contractor shall not install any software, applications, or utilities that are
limited in functionality based on the brand of BACnet based device. Any and all
required IDs and passwords for admin and programming level access to any
component or software program shall be provided to Owner. Hardcoded passwords
shall be forbidden. All Excel based tables shall be supplied in MS Excel compatible
version 2013 or greater as well as PDF versions.
H. The BMS shall include a single operating system software Tridium Niagara Framework
N4 including Niagara Security System. The Tridium Niagara BMS shall be licensed as
open, and not locked, protected, or proprietary to the BMS provider in any way that
interferes with the ability to own, operate, or have the BMS serviced by any other BMS
vendor or owner personnel.
I. All control devices furnished under this section shall be programmable directly from the
Niagara 4 Workbench embedded toolset for this project. The use of configurable or
programmable controllers that require additional software tools or tools that require a
specific Niagara 4 license to operate for post-installation maintenance shall not be
acceptable. Only systems that utilize the Niagara 4 Framework are acceptable.
J. The system shall incorporate the ability to access all data using HTML5 enabled
browsers without requiring proprietary operator interface and configuration programs or
browser plug-ins. An Open Database Connectivity ODBC or Structured Query
Language (SQL) compliant server database is required for all system database
parameter storage. This data shall reside on the Niagara enterprise Web Supervisor.
K. The Niagara Information Conformance Statement (NICS) for all Niagara Software shall
allow for open access and be set up as follows: accept.station.in=”*”
accept.station.out=”*” accept.wb.out=:*” accept.wb.in=”*”. All hardware and field level
devices installed for the project shall not be limited in the ability to communicate with a
specific brand of Niagara Framework device. The BAS Contractor shall not install any
“brand specific” software, applications, or utilities on Niagara Framework Device.

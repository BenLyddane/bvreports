      "rationale": "The specification for fan coil units calls for permanently lubricated, multispeed motors. By standardizing on premium efficiency EC (Electronically Commutated) motors, you'll achieve significant energy savings over traditional PSC motors while providing better comfort control through variable speed capabilities. Enviro-Tec (the BOD manufacturer) offers EC motor options for their HDD series.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Energy savings of 25-35% compared to standard PSC motors, providing an estimated payback period of 2-3 years, reduced maintenance costs due to longer motor life, and potential utility rebates for high-efficiency equipment selection.",
      "implementation": "1. Request Enviro-Tec HDD series with EC motor options in the bid submission\n2. Compare the initial cost premium against the calculated energy savings\n3. Ensure that the fan coil controls can properly interface with the EC motor's 0-10V control input\n4. Verify compatibility with the project's Building Management System",

By working with these manufacturers to pre-select standardized modular components that best meet the project requirements, you can reduce custom engineering time, minimize field assembly, and potentially optimize cost and delivery schedules.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Potential cost savings of 5-10% on AHU procurement, reduced on-site labor costs, shorter lead times by 2-4 weeks, and improved quality control with factory-assembled components.",
      "implementation": "1. Review the current AHU schedules and identify common modules across units\n2. Consult with York and Temtrol to recommend standardized module configurations\n3. Evaluate the cost savings of pre-engineered solutions versus fully custom units\n4. Include module standardization as a value engineering option in bidding documents",

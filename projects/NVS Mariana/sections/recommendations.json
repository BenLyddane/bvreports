      "recommendation": "Implement demand-controlled ventilation with air quality sensors",
      "rationale": "Current design provides constant air change rates regardless of actual occupancy or contaminant levels. Adjusting ventilation rates based on actual conditions could significantly reduce fan energy while maintaining safe laboratory environments.",
      "estimatedImpact": "20-30% reduction in fan energy consumption while maintaining safe laboratory conditions",
      "implementation": "Install air quality sensors in key zones and integrate with the VAV control system. Add occupancy sensors tied to the ventilation control system for further optimization.",

      "recommendation": "Implement chilled water temperature reset controls",
      "rationale": "Current fixed chilled water temperature does not account for varying cooling and dehumidification requirements. Raising the chilled water temperature during periods of lower humidity or reduced cooling loads can significantly improve chiller efficiency.",

      "recommendation": "Lower heating hot water temperature setpoint during shoulder seasons",
      "rationale": "Current design temperature range of 140-180°F doesn't maximize condensing boiler efficiency. Maintaining return water temperatures below 130°F whenever possible can significantly improve boiler efficiency.",

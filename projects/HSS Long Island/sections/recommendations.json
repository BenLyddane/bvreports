      "id": 1,
      "recommendation": "Early Procurement of Long Lead Items",
      "rationale": "The custom Haakon AHUs and AERMEC heat pump modules have 20-30 week lead times. Early procurement is critical to avoid project delays, especially given the May 2025 start date.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Prevention of 4-6 week project delays that could cost $50,000-$100,000 in extended general conditions and temporary measures.",
      "implementation": "1. Issue early equipment purchase orders for AHUs and heat pumps\n2. Secure storage if equipment arrives before installation readiness\n3. Coordinate delivery schedules with construction sequence\n4. Consider progressive payments to manufacturers to accelerate production",
      "priority": "High"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "recommendation": "Competitive Bidding for AHU Alternatives",
      "rationale": "Custom Haakon AHUs represent a significant cost, but three approved alternatives exist (CES/Ventrol, Nortek/Temtrol, Air Enterprise). Healthcare-grade specifications can be maintained while potentially reducing costs through competitive bidding.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Potential 5-15% cost reduction on AHU package while maintaining quality and performance specifications.",
      "implementation": "1. Develop detailed specification matrix of critical healthcare requirements\n2. Request quotes from all approved manufacturers\n3. Compare lifecycle costs, not just initial price\n4. Evaluate maintenance support availability from local representatives",
      "priority": "High"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "recommendation": "Modular Heat Pump System Optimization",
      "rationale": "The current design specifies seven AERMEC NYK500HD modules. Reconsidering the module count and sizing could maintain redundancy while reducing procurement costs and simplifying the hydronic connections.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Potential savings of 10-15% on heat pump system costs while maintaining redundancy requirements.",
      "implementation": "1. Evaluate 5 larger modules vs 7 smaller modules\n2. Verify N+1 redundancy is maintained with fewer modules\n3. Calculate efficiency at typical operating loads with different configurations\n4. Consider Multistack as competitive alternative to AERMEC",
      "priority": "Medium"

    {
      "id": 4,
      "recommendation": "Generator Package Competitive Bidding",
      "rationale": "The Caterpillar D600 GC generator specification can be met by multiple manufacturers (Kohler, Cummins, MTU). Healthcare applications require premium features, but competition can drive favorable pricing.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Potential 5-10% cost reduction on generator package through competitive bidding while maintaining reliability and performance.",
      "implementation": "1. Develop detailed healthcare-grade specifications\n2. Request bids from all four manufacturers with clear evaluation criteria\n3. Include service package options in bid evaluation\n4. Evaluate fuel efficiency and maintenance requirements",
      "priority": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "recommendation": "Transfer Switch Procurement Strategy",
      "rationale": "The specified Schneider Electric ASCO 7000 Series transfer switches are premium products, but alternatives from Russelectric, Cummins, Kohler, and Eaton could offer comparable quality at potentially lower costs.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Potential savings of 5-8% on transfer switch package while maintaining required performance for healthcare applications.",
      "implementation": "1. Verify all alternatives meet healthcare code requirements\n2. Request bids with specific healthcare-related performance criteria\n3. Consider bundling generator and transfer switch procurement if manufacturer offers both\n4. Evaluate warranty differences between options",

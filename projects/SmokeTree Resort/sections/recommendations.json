      "recommendation": "Explore leasing options for select equipment",
      "rationale": "Leasing can be a cost-effective option for some equipment by reducing upfront capital expenditure, providing tax advantages, and ensuring access to updated models in the future.",
      "estimatedImpact": "Leasing can reduce upfront equipment costs by 10-30% in many cases, improving cash flow. However, total cost of ownership should be analyzed for each leasing decision.",
      "implementation": "1. Identify resort equipment that could be good candidates for leasing based on anticipated usage, lifetime, maintenance needs, etc. 2. Obtain quotes from equipment leasing providers. 3. Conduct a cost/benefit analysis of leasing vs. purchase. 4. For items where leasing is advantageous, negotiate favorable rates and terms. 5. Establish processes for managing and returning leased equipment.",

Similarly, all fresh air intake located on the roof will be located minimum 25Õ-0Ó away from the any general exhaust and relief air to avoid any opportunity for the ingestion of containment and to exceed the minimum requirements from the ASHRAE standard 170 and 62.1.  4. Sustainability: Beyond airside economizer, the mechanical systems will be based on an integrated design approach where the design team (architects and engineers) collectively analyze and model the massing of the building to create a building that uses less energy.  The mechanical systems will be Òright sizedÓ and made-up of premium efficiency components.  Variable air-volume air system design will be implemented in all non-critical and non-clinical spaces to save energy. Variable frequency drives on fans and pumps will be provided to save energy at reduced demand times.    5. Reliability: Multiple-like sized pumps, heat exchangers, etc. serving like space will be headered together within respective mechanical rooms.  The coupling will provide 100% redundancy if any one system fails.  Through the use of controls and variable frequency drives, the space conditions will be hardly affected. The air handling unit will be designed to allow for a minimum one (1) fan failure while still maintaining 100% airflow. Unit and distribution systems will be designed with a minimum of 10% spare capacity.  D3010 - ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA A. Environmental Criteria 1.

The Engineered systems will be designed to meet ASHRAE 90.1 Ð 2019, Additional energy conservation and sustainability features considered are as follows: a. Enthalpy controlled economizer cycle for air conditioning systems, to take advantage of "cool" outside air to provide space cooling without or with reduced usage of refrigeration system. b. Use of variable air volume type air conditioning systems for areas which do not require constant humidity or maintained-pressure relationships with adjacent areas.  Variable speed motor drives for VAV system if it is economical and feasible, supply and returns fans.  VAV systems will incorporate air measuring stations to accurately control supply and return fan performance. c. Larger temperature differential (supply - return temperature) for chilled & hot water systems.  Primarily, this will involve application of chilled water equipment with temperature differentials of 14-16 degrees F and hot water with temperature differential of 30 degrees F. d. Use of variable speed pumping for all hydronic systems; hot water reheat & perimeter hot water radiation. e. Pre-heat and perimeter radiation hot water temperatures shall be reset to correspond with the outdoor temperature.   f. Fan Array for static pressure reduction and energy savings g. LED Lighting to reduce heat load and cooling demand h. Minimum Outdoor Air Measurement i.

Each sensor output is then sent to a signal transducer that will read all the sensors and pass through one signal that represents the sensor with the highest reading to the air handler k. As a result, ventilation rates will be controlled to ensure the most critical space is always adequately ventilated 2. Advanced Control Applications a. Optimal Start: starts HVAC equipment only as early as required to bring the building setpoints to comfort levels for occupancy b. Optimal Stop: Determines the earliest possible time to initiate setback temperatures before unoccupied periods while still maintaining occupant comfort c. Demand Limiting or Load Shedding: Monitors electric meters and current draw on high-demand equipment, then relaxes setpoints to immediately reduce demand. This technique can, for example, prevent a chiller from further loading, but can also globally change HVAC setpoints throughout the building to shed electric load to avoid peak utility charges 3. Air handling systems should operate with 100% outdoor air at the completion of construction activities.  Operation at 100% outside air would continue until enough time has passed to lower emitted contamination concentrations to near background levels.

Objective 1. The primary purpose of this report is to define the requirements, scope of work and other issues for audiovisual systems to be implemented in this space. 2. This document is based on the most current industry standards, and best industry practices as well as guidance received from JSUMC and the project team. 3. This basis of design documents will be utilized to set the minimum parameters to follow during the design process for the technology systems to be implemented in the facility. This document shall not be utilized to solicit competitive bids from contractors. Once this document is reviewed and approved by all relevant parties, it will be utilized as a guideline to develop construction documents which include detailed drawings and specifications. Only then shall the project construction manager solicit competitive bids. D9020 - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS A. General Requirements 1. The Project will contain conference rooms that may be used for presentations and teleconferencing. A/V requirements will be as diverse as the spaces that house them, depending on use, room size, and ancillary requirements. As such, design consideration for each space will be defined during the Design Development user group meeting process. Rooms will be designed using industryÕs best practices to provide a standardized feel between rooms. 2. The design team will provide the AV system requirements and specifications to the Architectural team and Owner for final design impact, pricing, and scheduling. Substantial input may be required from a steering committee or the ownerÕs representative. The structural support for ceiling and wall brackets is generally detailed and specified by the Architect. The equipment will be provided under separate contracts to the Owner, subcontracted by General Contractor. 3. Minimum AV Infrastructure should be installed in all audiovisual spaces, including those not identified on the summary below. This will minimize the impact of future AV installations. AV infrastructure includes the following:  a. Wall boxes for input panels and wall-mounted equipment  b. Floor boxes for movable tables and core drills for fixed tables  c. Power / data connectivity  d. Empty conduit and pull string at all boxes  e. Other infrastructure as required for special applications. D9030 - INFRASTRUCTURE VERSUS EQUIPMENT A. Infrastructure Versus Equipment 1. Though the actual amount of purchased equipment for initial installation may change, the intent is to provide complete infrastructure planning for eventual fit-out. If proper infrastructure provisions have been made, equipment can be added later as requirements change, without jeopardizing the integrity of the overall audiovisual systems design. 2. Infrastructure can be thought of as part of the overall building design. Audiovisual infrastructure refers to the necessary base building provisions such as operable walls, power outlets, conduit, junction boxes, projection screens, drapes, projector mounting support, etc., needed to make a room audio visually functional. It must be planned and included for initial occupancy, whether the audiovisual equipment is purchased or not. 3. Infrastructure items are not part of the audiovisual specifications. They are specified by the Architect & Electrical Engineer with inputs from the AV designer, furnished and installed by the general or electrical contractor as part of the base building and are not included in the audiovisual contractor's scope of work. 4. Equipment refers to audiovisual devices which have specific costs and capabilities associated with them. Equipment can be thought of as furniture; various choices can be made about its quality and quantity. 5. Equipment will be specified by Syska's AV designer and furnished and installed by an audiovisual contractor. It is important that equipment and infrastructure are planned simultaneously. 6. We suggest that the information presented is reviewed on two separate but related levels: The general intent to provide infrastructure that will support audiovisual capabilities, and the specific level of initial equipment purchase or fit-up. D9040 - DEDICATED, PORTABLE AND FUTURE PROVISION A.
